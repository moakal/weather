# ECS522U Weather App Project - Group 6

This is the 'travel' branch of the repository for the Group 6 Weather Application project.

In this branch, we are developing the feature for gathering the relevant lines based on the start and end locations, as well as the directions taken.

While the final prototype will likely look different from this, our current focus is on building a functional foundation, and from here we will refine the application towards our intended design.

## Usage

Currently, you enter the postcodes of your start and end points, and it will provide various routes, as well as instructions on taking these routes.

The time taken for these routes must be retrieved, as well as the statuses of the relevant lines.

2. Move into project directory
